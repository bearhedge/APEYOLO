Here’s a condensed, prose-style build brief you can paste into Replit. It keeps only the critical decisions and leaves implementation details to the tool.

APEYOLO — Agentic Dashboard (Monochrome)

Theme & Tone
	•	Keep current black/white palette. Minimal, high-contrast, generous whitespace. Numbers monospace, UI text sans. No colors for state; use icons/weight/labels.

Information Architecture
	•	Top Bar: APEYOLO • IBKR OAuth status (✓/×, last ping) • DeFi Bridge (wallet connect + chain label) • NAV.
	•	Three Columns: LeftNav (thin) • ChatCanvas (primary) • ContextPanel (condensed, fixed order).
	•	Pages: Dashboard (this), Agent, Portfolio, Trades, Jobs, Settings.

LeftNav (thin)
	•	Icons + labels: Dashboard / Agent / Portfolio / Trades / Jobs / Settings.

ChatCanvas (agent-first)
	•	Natural-language interface (OpenAI SDK). Messages can embed tables/charts.
	•	Presets: /analyze, /rebalance, /roll, /explain.
	•	Jobs model: every action = job with streaming states
QUEUED → VALIDATING → DRY_RUN → EXECUTING → CONFIRMED → DONE (or FAILED/HALTED).
	•	In-chat Task Card shows step ticks (policy ✓, positions ✓, risk ✓, dry-run (IRR/slippage), execute, confirm). Link “View details” → Jobs/:id.
	•	Charts embedded in messages (candlesticks; OTM delta barriers as dashed lines).

ContextPanel (right, ~28–32% width; stack these six cards in order)
	1.	Session: IBKR (✓/×, last ping), Oracle (✓/×), Policy vX + short hash, Mode (Aggression %).
	2.	Portfolio: NAV, Day P/L, Buying Power, Utilization %.
	3.	Risk: |Δ| vs cap, VaR(1d) vs cap, 30d Drawdown vs cap, Status (OK/Tighten/Halt).
	4.	Allocation (this epoch): compact table → Ticker | IRR_exp | IRR_stress | Weight | Margin.
	5.	Queue (next actions): timestamped Sell/Roll/Hedge items; “Open Jobs.”
	6.	Alerts: empty state or list (oracle stale, breach, failed order), linking to Logs/Jobs.

Dashboard Page (default view)
	•	Top Bar + three-column layout as above.
	•	Chat opens with a short system message (“Welcome back… Next scheduled action…”).
	•	ContextPanel pulls from a single /context source.

Other Pages
	•	Agent: same layout, larger ChatCanvas (context collapsible).
	•	Portfolio: full positions table (Symbol, Strategy, Qty, Entry/Mark, PnL, IRR, Δ, Margin), exposure charts, brief AI summary.
	•	Trades: executions log (filters, export, row hash).
	•	Jobs: list + detail timeline (all steps, payloads, timing).
	•	Settings: IBKR OAuth, DeFi wallet connect, policy editor (form → JSON with bounds), notifications.

Data & Realtime (skeletal contracts for Replit to infer)
	•	GET /api/context → { session, portfolio {nav, dayPnl, buyingPower, util}, risk {absDelta, var1d, dd30d, status, caps}, allocation[], queue[], alerts[] }.
	•	POST /api/jobs → { jobId } from intents like { intent:“ROLL”, params:{ticker, dte, targetDelta, qty} }.
	•	WS /api/jobs/:id/stream → step updates (states + optional metrics).
	•	GET /api/candles?symbol=… → OHLC + target strike/delta lines.

Charts (monochrome)
	•	Lightweight candlesticks; smooth updates (250–500ms throttle).
	•	OTM delta “barriers” as dashed horizontals with tooltips (Δ, distance).

Micro-Interactions
	•	Skeleton loaders (no spinners).
	•	Right-aligned numbers; left-aligned labels.
	•	Short, neutral microcopy (e.g., “All limits within bounds”, “No scheduled actions in 24h”).

Security & Safety (minimal)
	•	Read-only first (Hybrid Mirror): jobs stop at DRY_RUN; execution path stubbed.
	•	All actions pass risk checks before EXECUTING; failures produce HALTED with reason.

Build Order
	1.	Top Bar + three-column shell.
	2.	ContextPanel wired to /context.
	3.	Chat → POST /jobs + WS /jobs/:id/stream (simulate steps).
	4.	Portfolio & Trades (read-only).
	5.	Settings (OAuth + wallet connect + policy editor).

This is the skeleton: clean, agent-first, production-feel, and ready to scale to many users without changing the monochrome look.
